### âœ… Review & Contribution Flow

- Before starting, **create an issue** for the task you want to work on.
- **Assign yourself** to the issue so itâ€™s clear whoâ€™s working on it.
- Keep PRs focused: one issue = one PR (preferably small and scoped).
- All PRs need **at least one maintainer review**.
- We use **"Squash and merge"** to keep history clean.
- Address review comments quickly and respectfully.
