A comprehensive fitness coaching platform that allows create workout plans for you, track progress, and access a vast exercise database with
detailed instructions and video demonstrations.

## üéØ Project Origin & Motivation

This project was born from a personal mission to revive and improve upon a previous fitness platform. As the **primary contributor** to the
original [workout.lol](https://github.com/workout-lol/workout-lol) project, I witnessed its journey and abandonment. ü•π

### The Story Behind **_fitones_**

- üèóÔ∏è **Original Contributor**: I was the main contributor to workout.lol
- üíº **Business Challenges**: The original project faced major hurdles with exercise video partnerships (no reliable video provider) could
  be established
- üí∞ **Project Sale**: Due to these partnership issues, the project was sold to another party
- üìâ **Abandonment**: The new owner quickly realized that **exercise video licensing costs were prohibitively expensive**, began to be sick
  and abandoned the entire project
- üîÑ **Revival Attempts**: For the past **9 months**, I've been trying to reconnect with the new stakeholder
- üìß **Radio Silence**: Despite multiple (15) attempts, there has been no response
- üöÄ **New Beginning**: Rather than let this valuable work disappear, I decided to create a fresh, modern implementation

### Why **_fitones_** Exists

**Someone had to step up.**

The opensource fitness community deserves better than broken promises and abandoned platforms.

I'm not building this for profit.

This isn't just a revival : it's an evolution. **fitones** represents everything the original project could have been, with the
reliability, modern approach, and **maintenance** that the fitness open source community deserves.

## üë• From the Community, For the Community

**I'm not just a developer : I'm a user who refused to let our community down.**

I experienced firsthand the frustration of watching a beloved tool slowly disappear. Like many of you, I had workouts saved, progress
tracked, and a routine built around the platform.

### My Mission: Rescue & Revive.

_If you were part of the original workout.lol community, welcome back! If you're new here, welcome to the future of fitness platform
management._

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v8+)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Snouzy/fitones.git
   cd fitones
   ```

2. **Choose your installation method:**

<details>
<summary><b>üê≥ With Docker</b></summary>

### Docker Installation

1. **Copy environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Start everything for development:**

   ```sh
   make dev
   ```

   - This will start the database in Docker, run migrations, seed the DB, and start the Next.js dev server.
   - To stop services run `make down`

3. **Open your browser** Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>üíª Without Docker</b></summary>

### Manual Installation

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Copy environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Set up PostgreSQL database**

   - If you don't already have it, install PostgreSQL locally
   - Create a database named `fitones` : `createdb -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres fitones`

4. **Run database migrations**

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

5. **Seed the database (optional)**

See the - [Exercise database import section](#exercise-database-import)

6. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

7. **Open your browser** Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Exercise Database Import

The project includes a comprehensive exercise database. To import a sample of exercises:

### Prerequisites for Import

1. **Prepare your CSV file**

Your CSV should have these columns:

```
id,name,name_en,description,description_en,full_video_url,full_video_image_url,introduction,introduction_en,slug,slug_en,attribute_name,attribute_value
```

You can use the provided example.

### Import Commands

```bash
# Import exercises from a CSV file
pnpm run import:exercises-full /path/to/your/exercises.csv

# Example with the provided sample data
pnpm run import:exercises-full ./data/sample-exercises.csv
```

### CSV Format Example

```csv
id,name,name_en,description,description_en,full_video_url,full_video_image_url,introduction,introduction_en,slug,slug_en,attribute_name,attribute_value
157,"Fentes arri√®res √† la barre","Barbell Reverse Lunges","<p>Stand upright...</p>","<p>Stand upright...</p>",https://youtube.com/...,https://img.youtube.com/...,slug-fr,slug-en,TYPE,STRENGTH
157,"Fentes arri√®res √† la barre","Barbell Reverse Lunges","<p>Stand upright...</p>","<p>Stand upright...</p>",https://youtube.com/...,https://img.youtube.com/...,slug-fr,slug-en,PRIMARY_MUSCLE,QUADRICEPS
```

## Project Architecture

This project follows **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)** principles with Next.js App Router:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/ # Next.js pages, routes and layouts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ processes/ # Business flows (multi-feature)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ widgets/ # Composable UI with logic (Sidebar, Header)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/ # Business units (auth, exercise-management)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ entities/ # Domain entities (user, exercise, workout)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/ # Shared code (UI, lib, config, types)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/ # Global CSS, themes
```

### Architecture Principles

- **Feature-driven**: Each feature is independent and reusable
- **Clear domain isolation**: `shared` ‚Üí `entities` ‚Üí `features` ‚Üí `widgets` ‚Üí `app`
- **Consistency**: Between business logic, UI, and data layers

### Example Feature Structure

```
features/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ exercise-management/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/ # UI components (ExerciseForm, ExerciseCard)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model/ # Hooks, state management (useExercises)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/ # Utilities (exercise-helpers)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ api/ # Server actions or API calls
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: add amazing feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request (one issue = one PR)

**üìã For complete contribution guidelines, see our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)**

### Code Style
